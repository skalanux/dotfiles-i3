#
# i3-wrapper associates strings supplied by i3-input with programs.
#
# It is inspired by the configurable keyboard shortcuts for bookmarks
# in web browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome.
#
# Type a string and the corresponding program is brought into focus;
# if it is already running focus moves to its associate workspace,
# otherwise it is launched in the current workspace.
#
# Take care to match long strings before short strings beginning with
# identical substrings.
#
# The easiest match to use is 'instance' because the instance sring
# usually matches the program name. Using 'title' is complicated by
# the need to enclose the matched substring in quotes but it can be a
# good choice in some cases.
#
# Contains at least one bashism: (link deleted so I can post)
